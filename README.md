# FruitMeasure
A program to calculate your height in common fruits and vegetables. Written in C# using Windows Forms in Visual Studio.

Version 1.0:
>All calculations working, input exceptions are handled.
>Icons are included, made by my partner.
>Minor easter egg.

//TODO:
>Optimize, optimize, optimize! Even for such a simple program, RAM is through the roof.
Every time the fruit image is switched, that adds 6-8MB of RAM usage. Why? The pictures aren't even a MB each.
>Measure fruits myself at the market soon, for more reliable measurement data.
>Potentially add more fruits?
